    moo package for file manipulation and organization 
    
    version: 0.0.1

    author: moody

    language: python.   
    description:
    command line tool that clones the linux commands like touch, cat, and can delete a
    file or multiple files.
    

        flags: 
        --touch ==> create files with one touch.

        --cat ==> checking the content of a file.
        --delete ==> delete any file in any directory


        usage:
        
        moo <flag> fileName or a list of files but this works only in the touch and del
        command.
        so, in the cat flag, one file is is the only thing that should be specified
